# Earthsteading Mission Statement

To unlock a future where Australia's building boom thrives in harmony with our planet, by driving a circular economy in construction that eliminates waste, minimizes emissions, and empowers sustainable living for all.

## Earthsteading Values

These values support our mission statement:

 - Innovation for sustainability (beyond the current 1950's Building Code of Australia), e.g. performance solutions for earth materials like rammed earth, hempcrete, adobe, etc.
 - Luxury living through net negative emissions (not just building envelope 'efficient' homes), e.g. total cost of emobied carbon for lifespan of struture.
 - Meaningful legacy using material longevity (circular economy resuse of building materials), e.g. use of rich clay deposits in Victoria for bushfire and earthquake rammed earth adobe walls and recycled glass.

[For examples of the above values as projects, please see my list of open source projects](https://github.com/orgs/earthsteading/repositories?type=all).
