## FAQ
  - [ ] Q: How can Earthsteading Ltd help me with my off-grid build? --> A: A private building surveyor is focused on finding solutions to achieve your legacy build; as opposed to many council paid surveyors who are merely looking for any detail to delay your build.  A private building surveyor will save you time and money by expediating the council, state and federation legislation required for every structure in Australia. 
  - [ ] Q: But can I build an off-grid structure as 'a shed' (10m2) and not get in trouble with the council. --> A: False, every structure in Australia requires a planning and/or building permit.  Furthermore, if you are going to spend the significant time (sweat equity) in building a structure, you want it to have an occpancy permit so it can be insured against fire and have the potential to make you money by being sold legally.
